Long Version:
Spoiler 
1. This is free artwork here. But also remember that this artwork is a lot of stuff that I made for my own games, and I'm just passing it onto you guys. So yeah, please don't take credit for my work. No-brainer.
2. Speaking of free artwork, I myself believe that free should go hand-in-hand with free. So my artwork here should be for non-commercial use only. If you really want to use my art for a commercial game (oh, the horror!), PM me and we'll see if we can work it out. I'm sure we can  :)
3. Agghhh, no reposts, please! By this I mean please don't distribute by copying it over to other sites all over the place. I'd be charmed if you want to spread the love (and art), but since I'm not exactly an organized person, there's no way I'll be able to keep up with it all; plus this way, with it all on one site, it's much easier for me to answer any questions. Feel free to link to this page, though, I'd be honored!
6. Due to my spatially-challenged problems, I'll let you crop or resize any images you want, but no editing, please!  :)
9. Please credit me if you use my stuff  :) And for what, too, just to pique my interest. For example, in credits, say: Tsarmina-portraits. (You don't have to put a specific piece of art or anything, just general.)
